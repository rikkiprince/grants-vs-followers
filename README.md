grants-vs-followers
===================

A little hackday script to mashup Gateway to Research data with observatory.data.ac.uk data and see whether number of grants funded relates to Twitter followers.

Warning: makes use of a cURL wrapper that caches results, that isn't public yet. Will link it here once I publish (if ever)!
